We indicate to Python that we are writing a string by surrounding our content with quotation marks. Once we do this, we can operate on this string by calling methods like `upper()` or `endswith()`. We identified a general pattern for calling methods on datatypes: 'instance of a datatype-dot-method name-parentheses'.\n",

We saw the importance of guessing and experimentation, and how doing so can give us error messages, which provide clues. We also saw how to ask questions about a datatype by calling `help()` followed by the datatype name like `help(str)`.  Finally, we saw we can ask Google.  This mechanism of exploration is a skill we'll build up over time and this course will provide guidance and practice all along the way."

    "Let's say you have a management system that allows employees to put in their vacation days and the system has a way of auto tagging vacations as disruptive, average, or minimal based on the number of days being taken off. This helps to give immediate feedback for you so that you can make sure to plan deadlines and staff projects  appropriately. So, we'll use conditional statements that use the number of days taken off as the input to figure out if the vacation is disruptive, normal, or minimal. \n",

    "In this lesson, we saw how conditionals allow us to make decisions with our code by only executing code under the `if` statement when the conditional argument is `True` or truthy.  We then saw how we can use the `else` statement to only run code when the conditional argument is `False` or falsy, and as we know, code that is not in a conditional block is still run as normal. Next, we examined what is truthy or falsy, and saw that None, 0, empty strings, and lists are all falsy. If we are unsure, we can use the `bool` function to see the boolean equivalent of a piece of data. Finally, we used `if`, `elif`, and `else` statements together to make decisions based on the conditions of our problem."
